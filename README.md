# Reduce.Streamlit.App

## Description
This application provides an interactive visualization of dimensionality reduction techniques applied to a 3D dataset. The dataset could represent, for example, the expression of three different genes, with each dot representing one of 1000 cells. 

The dimensionality reduction methods used in this application are PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. PCA is a linear method, while t-SNE and UMAP are non-linear methods. 

In the visualizations, two points in the original data and in the reduced representations are connected by lines. One line is green and the other is red. These lines allow you to evaluate how well each method retains the distance between the cells. 

The application is built using Streamlit and uses matplotlib for visualizations and sklearn for the dimensionality reduction techniques. It's a great tool for students interested in data visualization, machine learning, or bioinformatics. 

## Live demo
